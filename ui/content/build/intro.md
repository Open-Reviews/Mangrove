Our aim is to create an open data ecosystem for reviews of places, companies, websites, books, and more. We provide open-source infrastructure that enables any application or website to integrate a reviews layer, and to benefit from a shared data pool that is created by the combined user base.   
   
Mangrove provides  
* A [technical standard](https://gitlab.com/plantingspace/mangrove/-/blob/master/Mangrove_Review_Standard.md) to ensure interoperability
* An open-source [API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/keorn/Mangrove_Server/0.1.0)
* An aggregation algorithm to clean and filter the data
* A downloadable open dataset licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)  

Mangrove is a non-profit service hosted and supported by a community of businesses, developers and interested parties around the world. Contact us to discuss your integration.
