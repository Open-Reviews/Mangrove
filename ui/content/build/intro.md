The aim of the Mangrove project is to create an **open data ecosystem for online reviews** to displace proprietary services and make this valuable source of insight freely accessible. This will allow for more open innovation and competition based on technological merit instead of access to restricted data.   

**We are taking three steps to make this happen:**  
(1) Building robust infrastructure to enable the **creation of a useful open dataset** for reviews.  
(2) Providing **open-source tools** that allow anyone to easily integrate a reviews layer into their products and services.   
(3) Supporting organisations and individuals in becoming part of the ecosystem and making it jointly successful.

Mangrove is a non-profit service hosted and supported by a community of businesses, developers and interested parties around the world.
