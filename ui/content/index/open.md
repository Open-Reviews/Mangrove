title: Don’t let your insights end up in data silos

OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, the Internet Archive: all of them stand for free access to essential information to foster inclusion, free competition, and a civil society.

Mangrove is part of this movement: by building an **open dataset** for online reviews, based on an **open-source infrastructure**, we make this valuable source of insight freely available to all.

Businesses and Entrepreneurs can **integrate Mangrove freely** to create numerous great services and products to help us navigate our complex world by leveraging each other’s experiences.
