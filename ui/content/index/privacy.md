title: Experience a service that does not track you

Requiring registration of users’ name, email, phone number, birthday; tracking users’ behaviour; and storing their most sensitive data is unavoidable? 

No!

Building great services that involve identity and reputation is possible without all that, and we want to prove it. 

Mangrove lets you **have an identity and build reputation without requiring registration** or sharing your data with us.
