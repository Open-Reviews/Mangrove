* **You can create several public keys** within Mangrove; e.g., if you would like to review something that should not be listed under your main public key.
* **Reputation, however, is linked to the public key** as it is your “identifier” in the system. In order to build up reputation you need amongst other things a track record of reviews under the same public key.
* You can **create a new public key in the Write-a-Review window**. You can choose each time you write a review under which public key to publish. 
* If you create a new public key when submitting a review, **it will later appear here** in your Account Settings.
* If you want to use a public key generated on another device or browser, click the “**Switch Account**” button to import it here.
* We recommend to save your private key in a password manager accessible across different devices and browsers, so that you don’t lose access to your public keys.


- The public key represents an identifier for a reviewer, and it is stored together with each review. 
- You can create several public keys by clicking “Create a new public key”. 
When you write a review, the “Default public key” will be picked as an identifier, so make sure you check first here in Settings which of your public keys is currently the default one.
- Reputation within Mangrove is built when the system sees many high-quality reviews under the same public key. The higher your reputation, the more weight your reviews get in the final rating. If you would like to build up reputation, make sure you use mostly the same public key.
- You can display for each public key you created the associated reviews on the right by clicking on the public key.
