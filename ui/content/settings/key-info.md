title: "How to manage your account in Mangrove"
---

An account in Mangrove consists of a cryptographically generated pair of keys.

The **secret key** represents your self-controlled password. It is generated on your local device and is not stored on Mangrove’s servers. 

The **public key** represents your identifier that will be displayed with each review you write. It keeps track of your reputation and is part of ensuring the reliability of the aggregated ratings, as the aggregation algorithm gives higher weight to a public key that has published many high-quality reviews.

By default, a new account (a new key pair) is generated each time you access Mangrove from a new device or after clearing your browser data.

To be able to write reviews under a previously used identifier (public key), you need to access your previous account with the respective secret key. Simply click the “Switch account” button, and import the secret key of the account you would like to use.
