An account in Mangrove consists of a **cryptographically generated pair of keys**. 

The secret key represents your self-controlled password (Mangrove does not have access to your secret key). The public key represents your identity that will be displayed with each review you write, and that keeps track of your reputation.

By default, a new account (a new key pair) is generated each time you access Mangrove from a new device or clear your browser data. Only if you have saved your secret key (ideally in a cross-device password manager), you can access a previously used account across devices and browsers. This allows you to write new reviews with the same identity, and build your reputation.

To access a previously used account simply click the “Switch account” button, and import the respective secret key.
