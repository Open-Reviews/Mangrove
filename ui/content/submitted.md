This is a good moment to **save your secret key**, if not done already. 

* **Your secret key is like a password**, with the difference that it lives on your own device, and is not stored on Mangroveâ€™s servers.
* It lets you maintain one identity in the system and **allows for a number of useful features** such as building your reputation. 
* Save your secret key ideally in a **password manager** so that you can access your account again in case you switch to another device, or clear your browser data.

It is as simple as a normal login, yet fundamentally superior as it **puts you in control** of your data and identity.
