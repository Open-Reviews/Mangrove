title: Thank you for your review. Please save your secret key.

Mangrove respects your privacy and doesn’t store your identity. By default a new account is created whenever you access Mangrove on a different device or clear your browser data. If you like to keep a consistent identity and access your previous reviews, you need to save your secret key (ideally within a password manager, such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)) and import it on the new device in Mangrove’s [account settings](settings). 

It is as simple as a normal login, yet fundamentally superior as it puts you in control of your data and identity.
