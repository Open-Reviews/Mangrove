This is a good moment to **save your private key**, if not done already. 

* Your private key is used to create a digital signature to authenticate you so that no one else can write reviews with your identifier. 
* It lets you maintain one identity within Mangrove without the need to register, and allows for a number of useful features such as building your reputation. 
* It is only stored temporarily in your browserâ€™s local storage, so **we recommend saving it ideally in a password manager**, so that you can access it from any device.
