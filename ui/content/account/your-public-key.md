title: Public key
---

The **public key** is stored with each review in the database and serves as an identifier for a user, allowing you to build a reputation within Mangrove to make your opinion count more. This is because the algorithm that aggregates individual reviews to a final rating gives higher weight to public keys that have published many high-quality reviews. This is part of ensuring a high reliability of the ratings. The public key is cryptographically derived from the private key.
