title: Your private key
---

The **private key** is used to create a digital signature to authenticate you so that no one else can write reviews with your public key. It is in a [JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) format.

By default, a new key pair is generated each time you access Mangrove from a new device, a new browser, or after clearing your browser data. To be able to write reviews under a previously used public key, you need to have access to the corresponding private key. **We recommend storing it in a password manager** so that it can be accessed across devices.
