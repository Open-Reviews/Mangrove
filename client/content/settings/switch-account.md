* “Switching account” in Mangrove means to **switch to another pair of private and public keys**. An “account” is associated with a specific private key and the public keys that belong to it.
* If you **used Mangrove on another device or browser** and would like to write reviews with the public key(s) you generated there, you need to **import the respective private key**. 
* **This will allow you to access and use the associated public keys, and see your reviews.**
* Before you switch, don’t forget to **save the current private key** in a password manager that you can use across devices so that you don’t lose access to it.
