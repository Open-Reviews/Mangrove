Vision and mission, organisation, team, roadmap, etc.  

Mangrove is a non-profit initiative to create a public space on the Internet where people can freely share insights with each other and make better decisions based on open data.

## We all know what's wrong
Our world is becoming increasingly complex to navigate., recommendations and reviews have become indispensable for people when deciding where to go, where to eat, which product to buy, and where to buy it - in general, what to put their time and money into. 

Yet, a small number of companies with unprecedented power came to control this development, exploiting their proprietary access to user content, users' activity data, as well as their control over the feed of recommendations and reputation of businesses, for profit and more power. Without adequate alternatives, these information monopolies threaten both, free will and free markets today.

## Mangrove offers an alternative
To instantiate openness and privacy, we are proposing an alternative architecture for reviews that is characterized by a **separation of data and product**, and that is designed to respect the privacy of users:

* Review **data**, representing the insights, knowledge and wisdom of the public, should be open and freely available to all. As such, it provides a valuable foundation for many use-cases, including research, social or commercial purposes.

* **Products** (i.e., applications and services) that are built upon crowd-sourced data should base their business models on innovation and technological merit, and not on enclosing the commons. An architecture that separates data from product helps remove barriers to entry and avoids information silos.

* The **privacy** of users has to be protected by design, not by promises or declarations. In Mangrove, no personal information and no metadata is collected on the 'data layer'. Instead, public key cryptography is used to establish the notion of identity, fully controlled by the user. If service providers need to collect user data to enable their services, they may do so in their user interfaces on the 'products layer', affecting only those users who trust their particular services.

This approach is inspired by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about), an initiative to create and provide free geographic data, such as street maps, to anyone. With a community of [5.8 million](https://www.openstreetmap.org/stats/data_stats.html) registered users who have jointly uploaded 7.5 billion GPS points, OpenStreetMap powers map data on thousands of web sites, mobile apps, and hardware devices for commercial, humanitarian or social purposes, and has truly enhanced human capabilities on a global scale. 

We hope that the Mangrove open data set for reviews can become a valuable additional layer of data to make community-driven and open source projects even more competitive against closed-source, centralized players. And that it can serve entrepreneurs to innovate without facing barriers to entry.
